# What-s-App-Automated-Message-Python-Script

Welcome to What's App Automated Message sender. 

First thing you need to do is create an empty group and pin the chat. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT
After that run the script, Enter the name of the pinned group and time interval.

Scan the QR Code through your mobile What's App -> WhatsApp Web
That's it. The message you have entered will be sent to all the newly received messages.


Note : If you don't want to send this message to certain people or group. Mute them. The Script will ignore all the chats that are muted
